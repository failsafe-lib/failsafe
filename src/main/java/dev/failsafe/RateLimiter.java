/**
 * A rate limiter allows you to control the rate of executions as a way of preventing system overload.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of rate limiting: <i>smooth</i> and <i>bursty</i>. <i>Smooth</i> rate limiting will evenly spread
 * out execution requests over-time, effectively smoothing out uneven execution request rates. <i>Bursty</i> rate
 * limiting allows potential bursts of executions to occur, up to a configured max per time period.</p>
 * <p>Rate limiting is based on permits, which can be requested in order to perform rate limited execution.
 * Permits are automatically refreshed over time based on the rate limiter's configuration.</p>
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods that block while waiting for permits to become available, and also methods that return
 * immediately. The blocking methods include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #acquirePermit()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #acquirePermits(int)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #acquirePermit(Duration)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #acquirePermits(int, Duration)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #tryAcquirePermit(Duration)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #tryAcquirePermits(int, Duration)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * The methods that return immediately include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #tryAcquirePermit()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #tryAcquirePermits(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class also provides methods that throw {@link RateLimitExceededException} when permits cannot be acquired, and
 * also methods that return a boolean. The {@code acquire} methods all throw {@link RateLimitExceededException} when
 * permits cannot be acquired, and the {@code tryAcquire} methods return a boolean.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is threadsafe.
