  /**
   * Creates and returns a new {@link FailsafeExecutor} instance that will handle failures according to the given
   * policies. The policies are composed around an execution and will handle execution results in reverse, with the last

   * <p>
   * <pre>
   *   Failsafe.with(fallback, retryPolicy, circuitBreaker).get(supplier);
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * This is equivalent to composition using the the {@link FailsafeExecutor#compose(Policy) compose} method:
   * <pre>
   *   Failsafe.with(fallback).compose(retryPolicy).compose(circuitBreaker).get(supplier);
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   * These result in the following internal composition when executing a {@code runnable} or {@code supplier} and
   * handling its result:
   * <p>
   * <pre>
   *   Fallback(RetryPolicy(CircuitBreaker(Supplier)))
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   * This means the {@code CircuitBreaker} is first to evaluate the {@code Supplier}'s result, then the {@code
   * RetryPolicy}, then the {@code Fallback}. Each policy makes its own determination as to whether the result
   * represents a failure. This allows different policies to be used for handling different types of failures.
