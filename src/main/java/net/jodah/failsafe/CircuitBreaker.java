/**
 * A circuit breaker that temporarily halts execution when configurable thresholds are exceeded.
 * <p>
 * A circuit breaker has three states: <i>closed</i>, <i>open</i>, and <i>half-open</i>. When a circuit breaker is in
 * the <i>closed</i> (initial) state, executions are allowed. If a {@link #withFailureThreshold(int) configurable
 * number} of failures occur, the circuit breaker transitions to the <i>open</i> state. In the <i>open</i> state a
 * circuit breaker will fail executions with {@link CircuitBreakerOpenException}. After a {@link #withDelay(Duration)
 * configurable delay}, the circuit breaker will transition to a <i>half-open</i> state. In the
 * <i>half-open</i> state a {@link #withSuccessThreshold(int) configurable number} of trial executions will be allowed,
 * after which the circuit breaker will transition back to <i>closed</i> or <i>open</i> depending on how many were
 * successful.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: CircuitBreaker extends {@link DelayablePolicy} and {@link FailurePolicy} which offer additional configuration.
 * </p>
