/**
 * A circuit breaker temporarily blocks execution when a configured number of failures are exceeded.
 * <p>
 * Circuit breakers have three states: <i>closed</i>, <i>open</i>, and <i>half-open</i>. When a circuit breaker is in
 * the <i>closed</i> (initial) state, executions are allowed. If a {@link #withFailureThreshold(int) configurable
 * number} of failures occur, optionally over some {@link #withFailureThreshold(int, Duration) time period}, the circuit
 * breaker transitions to the <i>open</i> state. In the <i>open</i> state a circuit breaker will fail executions with
 * {@link CircuitBreakerOpenException}. After a {@link #withDelay(Duration) configurable delay}, the circuit breaker
 * will transition to a <i>half-open</i> state. In the
 * <i>half-open</i> state a {@link #withSuccessThreshold(int) configurable number} of trial executions will be allowed,
 * after which the circuit breaker will transition back to <i>closed</i> or <i>open</i> depending on how many were
 * successful.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A circuit breaker can be <i>count based</i> or <i>time based</i>. A <i>count based</i> circuit breaker will
 * transition between states when recent execution results exceed a threshold. A <i>time based</i> circuit breaker will
 * transition between states when recent execution results exceed a threshold within a time period. A minimum number of
 * executions must be performed in order for a state transition to occur.
 * </p>
 * <p>Time based circuit breakers use a sliding window to aggregate execution results. The window is divided into
 * {@code 10} time slices, each representing 1/10th of the {@link #getFailureThresholdingPeriod()
 * failureThresholdingPeriod}. As time progresses, statistics for old time slices are gradually discarded, which
 * smoothes the calculation of success and failure rates.</p>
 * <p>
 * Note: CircuitBreaker extends {@link DelayablePolicy}, {@link FailurePolicy}, and {@link PolicyListeners} which offer
 * additional configuration.
 * </p>
