### Versioning

Failsafe follows MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning where:

- MAJOR versions contain significant new features and potentially significant incompatible API changes.
- MINOR versions contain new features and potentially minor yet incompatible API changes.
- PATCH versions contain bug fixes and minor new features that are fully backwards compatible.

All versions, new features, and API changes are described in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
