# 2.4.0

### Improvements

- Added time based thresholding support to `CircuitBreaker` via:
  - `withFailureThreshold(int failureThreshold, Duration failureThresholdingPeriod)`
  - `withFailureThreshold(int failureThreshold, int failureExecutionThreshold, Duration failureThresholdingPeriod)`
  - `withFailureRateThreshold(int failureRateThreshold, int failureExecutionThreshold, Duration failureThresholdingPeriod)`
- Added getters to `CircuitBreaker` for existing count based thresholding settings:
  - `getFailureThresholdingCapacity()`
  - `getSuccessThresholdingCapacity()`
- And added getters to `CircuitBreaker` for new time based thresholding settings:
  - `getFailureRateThreshold()`
  - `getFailureExecutionThreshold()`
  - `getFailureThresholdingPeriod()` 
- Added some new metrics to `CircuitBreaker`:
  - `getSuccessRate()`
  - `getFailureRate()`
  - `getExecutionCount()` 

### API Changes

- Changed the return type of `CircuitBreaker`'s `getFailureThreshold()` and `getSuccessThreshold()` from `Ratio` to `int`.
- Removed support for the previously deprecated `CircuitBreaker.withTimeout`. The `Timeout` policy should be used instead.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed #242 - Delays not occurring between manually triggered async execution retries.

# 2.3.4

### Improvements

### Improvements

* [Policy composition](README.md#policy-composition) is now supported.
* [A Policy SPI](README.md#policy-spi) is now available.

### JRE Changes

- Java 8+ is now required

### API Changes

Failsafe 2.0 includes a few API changes from 1.x that were meant to consolidate behavior such as the execution APIs, which are now based on common `Policy` implementations, while adding some new features such as `Policy` composition.

- Policies
  - Policy implementations now take a type parameter `R` that represents the expected result type.
  - Some of the time related policy configurations have been changed to use `Duration` instead of `long` + `TimeUnit`.
- Policy configuration
  - Multiple policies can no longer be configured by chaining multiple `Failsafe.with` calls. Instead they must be supplied in a single `Failsafe.with` call. This is was intentional to require users to consider the ordering of composed policies. See the README section on [policy composition](README.md#policy-composition) for more details.
- RetryPoilicy
  - The `retryOn`, `retryIf`, and `retryWhen` methods have been replace with `handleOn`, etc.
- CircuitBreaker
  - The `failOn`, `failIf`, and `failWhen` methods have been replace with `handleOn`, etc.
- Fallbacks
  - Fallbacks must be wrapped in a `Fallback` instance via `Fallback.of`
- Failsafe APIs
  - `Supplier`s are now used instead of `Callable`s.
  - `java.util.function.Predicate` is used instead of Failsafe's internal Predicate.
  - `withFallback` is no longer supported. Instead, `Failsafe.with(fallback...)` should be used.
- Async execution
  - Async execution is now performed with the `getAsync`, `runAsync`, `getStageAsync`, etc. methods.
  - Async API integration is now supported via the `getAsyncExecution`, `runAsyncExecution`, etc. methods.
- Event listeners
  - Event listeners now all consume a single `ExecutionEvent` object, which includes references to the result, failure, and other information.
  - Event listeners that are specific to policies, such as `onRetry` for `RetryPolicy`, must now be configured through the policy instance. The top level `Failsafe` API only supports `onComplete`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure`. Individual `Policy` implementations still support  `onSuccess` and `onFailure` in addition to policy specific events.
  - The top level `Failsafe.onSuccess` event listener will only be called if *all* configured policies consider an execution to be successful, otherwise `onFailure` will be called. 
  - The `Listeners` class was removed, since it was mostly intended for Java 6/7 users.
  - The async event listener APIs were removed. Events will always be delivered in the same thread as the execution that they follow or preceed, including for async executions.
- Java 8
  - `java.time.Duration` is used instead of Failsafe's own `Duration` impl.
  - `ChronoUnit` is used instead of `TimeUnit` in policies.
- `ExecutionContext.getExecutions` is now `getAttemptCount`.
- `Schedulers.of(ScheduledExecutorService)` was moved to the `Scheduler` interface.

### API Additions

- `CircuitBreaker`
  - `preExecute` is now exposed to support standalone usage.
  - Execution metrics are available via `getFailureCount`, `getFailureRatio`, `getSuccessCount`, and `getSuccessRatio`.
